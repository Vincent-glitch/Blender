# Blender
Base repo for all Blender code.

## Space Scene Builder

The repository includes `space_scene.py`, a Blender 4.x compatible script
that procedurally generates a rich outer space fly‑through:

* Procedural starfield world
* Earth‑like planet with rings and a moon
* Gas giant, asteroid belt, and glowing sun
* Volumetric nebula
* Animated camera path with depth of field

### Usage

1. Open Blender 4.x and switch to the **Scripting** workspace.
2. Load `space_scene.py` in the text editor.
3. Press **Run Script** to build the scene.

The script supports both Eevee Next and Cycles render engines.
